1) Before diving very deep, let's understand what is a variable :-
  · Variables are like containers that store data values.
  · In Python, you don’t need to specify the type of the variable; it automatically understands based on the value assigned.
  · Here are the examples...
'''

x = 10  # Integer variable
y = 3.14  # Float variable
name = "Your name"  # String variable
is_student = True  # Boolean variable

'''
If you type ' print(type(x)) ' it will show what variable it is using.
Note: Boolean consist only 'True' or 'False'
'''

2) In Python there are many kinds of Data Types, let's learn one by one :-
  a) Numbers:-
    · Integers (Whole numbers like 1, 2, 100)
    · Floats (Decimal numbers like 3.14, 0.001)
    · Here are some examples...
'''

age = 16  # Integer
pi = 3.1415  # Float

'''
Now here's a quick way to remember, if there is a decimal point, it is a Float or else it is a Integer.
'''
'''
  b) Strings:-
    · They are the sequence of characters, used for text.
    · You can use single, double, or triple quotes.
    · Some examples...
'''

name = "Nadeem"  # Using double quotes
greeting = 'Hello!'  # Using single quotes
paragraph = '''This is
a multiline
string.'''  # Using triple quotes
